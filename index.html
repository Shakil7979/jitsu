                            But BJJ didn't start out as the fastest growing martial art on the planet or the darling of militaries and police around the world. BJJ had to first earn the respect of thousands of regular people, one bullied kid at a time and one No-Holds-Barred victory after another.

                        <p>GroundBreaker BJJ is No Ordinary Self-Defence School or Generic Sport BJJ Academy</p>
                        <p>We were the first school of our kind in the entire nation and among <span class="red_color">only a handful of elite, “first generation” Gracie/Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu academies in all of North American</span> and the rest of the world.</p>
                        <h4>Therefore, we have the unique and proud distinction of being...</h4>

                            <p>CANADA'S FIRST, OLDEST AND MOST PRACTICAL SCHOOL OF BRAZILIAN JIU-JITSU & MMA <span>Founded 1991</span></p>
                            
                        </div>

                        <p>No one should have to go through what we did to get our  Brazilian Jiu-jitsu  training - and <span class="red_color">to bring the system
                            to Canada for the first time in history</span>.  We traveled thousands of miles,  made all kinds of personal and financial sacrifices and routinely had to face down threats and even physical violence. It wasn’t cheap, it wasn’t easy and it sure wasn’t always fun - but <span class="red_color">we felt it was well worth the sacrifices and was something we had to do</span>.</p>


                        <p>Back in those days,  before the  UFC or  MMA  even existed,  we had no idea how popular BJJ would eventually
                            become and we didn’t really care.  <span class="red_color">We didn’t do it to make ourselves popular</span>  or to follow a fad.  We didn’t  do
                            it to get a new belt or a cheap tournament medal - or whatever other trivial stuff motivates  the BJJ community these days.</p>


                        <p>We did it because  <span class="red_color">we were in the midst of a historic crime wave</span>  and  saw what the epidemic  of  interpersonal violence  was  doing  to  our communities  and  society.  We did it because  <span class="red_color">we`d  had  enough</span>  of a martial arts establishment  that  had  betrayed the trust and utterly failed the very people that needed it the most.  And we did it because we knew <span class="red_color">something had to be done</span> about a “self-defence” industry so irresponsible that it didn’t  seem to care if it got <span class="red_color">people humiliated, hurt - or worse</span>.</p>
                        <h6>but in the end we did it simply because...</h6>
                        <h6 class="red_color">Good people needed Brazilian Jiu-jitsu and it was our mission to help them get it.</h6>
                        <h4>WE BELIEVED EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO...</h4>

I was looking to take a self-defence class because I was going to be leaving on a world tour, by myself, later that year. I kind of kept putting it off because I was busy with school, work and life. But my Mom kept bugging me about it, as she thought I would be safer traveling alone if I at least knew how to defend myself. I knew she was right, so seven months before my trip I started.

                                        “Old school”  Brazilian  Jiu - jitsu  took  the  martial arts world by storm and literally fought for its reputation as the the planet’s most complete, efficient and effective system of self - defence.  But  “self - defence”  means so much more than just protection against physical aggression.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The healthy body that Jiu-jitsu cultivates is our first  line of defence against illness and disease.  Jiu-jitsu can be the perfect self-defence against threats like  obesity  and  its  deadly  complications  of  diabetes, heart disease and stroke.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For a society that  is  growing older Jiu - jitsu is self - defence against aging, loss  of  mobility  and  arthritis.   For young and old alike  BJJ  brings people together  and  guards  us  not  only   from   boredom   and   aimlessness  but against disconnection and isolation.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Yet for many, their greatest adversary is their own mind. Stress and anxiety can be more harmful than  physical  attacks.   But learning to be calm in the face of danger vanquishes  fear, doubt  and  worry  and  is  the very essence of Jiu-jitsu training.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        If  emotional  traumas  or  fighting back against the negativity of your inner critic, makes your mind feel like a battleground - then Jiu - jitsu can be your invisible weapon - to slay personal demons  and  protect  your  psyche from within and without.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Thus,  Jiu - jitsu is defence of the whole  “self”  and your entire being - your mind, your body and your spirit. Jiu-jitsu is like a superpower - the warrior’s  ultimate secret weapon  that no one can see  but is always with you.

                            <p>Everyone desires to feel like a warrior, to be powerful, confident, fearless and free. We all want that force of will to overcome  any  challenge and  the strength of character to always stand up for ourselves,  the people we care about and the things we believe to be right.</p>
                            <p>But not everyone  believes in themselves. Far too many good people worry that they do  not  have what it takes.
